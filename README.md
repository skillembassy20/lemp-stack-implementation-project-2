# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LEMP STACK)

Project 2 covers similar concepts as [Project 1](https://github.com/skillembassy20/lamp-stack-implementation-project-1) and helps to cement your skills of deploying Web solutions using LA(E)MP stacks.

You have done a great job with successful completion of Project 1.

In this project you will implement a similar stack, but with an alternative Web Server - [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/), which is also very popular and widely used by many websites in the Internet.
